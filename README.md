# microphi
Microphi is an open-source python project which provides functions to transform solid solutions from one basis to another. It can either be used to convert between different endmember sets, or to compute macroscopic endmember and interaction energies from microscopic site properties and interactions.

The motivation for this project is a paper from Roger Powell and coauthors (2014; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jmg.12070).
